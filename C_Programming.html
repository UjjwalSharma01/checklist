                        <p>C is a versatile, high-level programming language that finds its application in a wide array
                            of software and application development, system programming, game development, web
                            programming, and more. It was in 1972 when Dennis M. Ritchie, working at the Bell Telephone
                            Laboratories, birthed this programming gem. Originally intended for programming the UNIX
                            operating system, C has grown to become one of the most widely used and influential
                            programming languages out there.</p>

                        <p>1. Genesis of C: C had its beginnings in the early 1970s at Bell Telephone Laboratories.
                            Dennis
                            Ritchie was the brain behind this creation.</p>

                        <p>2. B Language Predecessor: Before C, there was a programming language called B, which Ken
                            Thompson
                            developed. B was influenced by BCPL and was primarily used for the Multics operating system.
                        </p>

                        <p>3. Birth of C: Ritchie and his team wanted to enhance the capabilities and efficiency of B.
                            Their
                            efforts resulted in the birth of C, originally referred to as "NB" (New B). The work on C
                            started in 1972 and continued into 1973.</p>

                        <p>4. C for Unix: One of the primary goals of C was to provide a more efficient and versatile
                            language
                            for developing the Unix operating system. At the time, Unix was primarily written in
                            assembly
                            language, making it less portable across different computer architectures. C changed that.
                        </p>

                        <p>5. Portability: C's design for system programming allowed Unix to be easily ported to various
                            hardware platforms. This portability became one of the key factors in Unix's widespread
                            adoption.</p>

                        <p>6. The C Book: In 1973, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published "The C Programming
                            Language,"
                            often referred to as "K&R C." This book became the definitive reference for the language and
                            played a significant role in popularizing C among programmers and institutions.</p>

                    <div class="hidden-text">
                        <P>1. Choose an Operating System:

                            You can develop C programs on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and
                            macOS.
                            Your choice depends on your preferences and the platform you intend to target.</P>

                        <P>2. Select a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

                            You have several options for writing C code. You can choose a simple text editor or a
                            specialized C programming IDE. Some popular choices include:

                            - Text Editors:
                            - Notepad (Windows)
                            - Visual Studio Code
                            - Sublime Text
                            - Atom

                            - C-Specific IDEs:
                            - Code::Blocks
                            - Dev-C++
                            - CLion
                            - Eclipse C/C++ IDE

                            - Linux Development Tools:
                            - On Linux, you can use text editors like Vim or Emacs along with GCC (GNU Compiler
                            Collection)
                            for compiling.</P>

                        <P>3. Install a C Compiler:

                            You need a C compiler to compile and execute your C programs. The most commonly used C
                            compiler
                            is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). Here's how to install GCC on different platforms:

                            - Linux: Most Linux distributions come with GCC pre-installed. If not, you can use your
                            package manager to install it. For example, on Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install
                            build-essential`.

                            - Windows: You can use MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) to install GCC on Windows.
                            Download the MinGW installer and follow the installation instructions.

                            - macOS: On macOS, you can use the Xcode Command Line Tools, which include GCC. Open a
                            terminal and run `xcode-select --install` to install these tools.</P>

                        <P>4. Write and Compile Your First C Program:

                            Now that you have a text editor, C compiler, and development environment set up, you can
                            write
                            your first C program. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example:

                            ```c
                            #include <stdio.h>

                                int main() {
                                printf("Hello, World!\n");
                                return 0;
                                }
                                ```

                                Save this code in a file with a `.c` extension, such as `hello.c`.</P>

                        <P>5. Compile and Run Your Program:

                            - On the command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your C file.
                            - Compile the program using the C compiler. For GCC, you can use the following command: `gcc
                            -o hello hello.c` (This compiles `hello.c` and produces an executable named `hello`.)
                            - Run the program by entering `./hello` (on Linux/macOS) or `hello.exe` (on Windows).</P>

                        <P>6. Debugging Tools (Optional):

                            For debugging your C programs, consider using a debugger like GDB (GNU Debugger) or the
                            built-in debugging tools provided by your chosen IDE.

                            That's a basic overview of setting up a C programming development environment. As you gain
                            more experience, you can explore additional tools and libraries to enhance your development
                            process.</P>

                            spaces and tabs to indent your code, and you can use line breaks to separate different
                            sections of code.</p>

                            least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional
                            functions.</p>
                        <p>A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and
                            parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.</p>

                        <p>A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body.

                        <pre class="code-block">
• Return Type - A function may return a value. 
  The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns.
  Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. 
  In this case, thereturn_type is the keyword void.

• Function Name - This is the actual name of the function. 
  The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature. 
  Parameters - A parameter is like a placeholder. 
  When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. 
  This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. 
  The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. 
  Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.

• Function Body - The function body contains a collection of statements 
  that define what the function does.

                        <p>While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a
                            function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.</p>
                        <p>When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A
                            called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when
                            its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the
                            main program.</p>
                        <p>To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function
                            name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For

                    <div class="hidden-text">
                        <p>The scope of a variable in C is the region of code where the variable can be accessed. The
                            lifetime of a variable in C is the time period during which the variable exists in memory.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are two main types of scopes in C: global and local. Global variables are declared
                            outside of any function, and they can be accessed from anywhere in the program. Local
                            variables are declared inside of a function, and they can only be accessed from within that
                            function.</p>
                        <p>The lifetime of a variable is determined by its scope. Global variables have a lifetime that
                            lasts for the entire program, while local variables have a lifetime that lasts only for the
                            duration of the function in which they are declared.</p>
                        <p>There are also two main types of lifetimes in C: static and automatic. Static variables are
                            declared with the static keyword, and they exist in memory for the entire lifetime of the
                            program. Automatic variables are declared without the static keyword, and they exist in
                            memory only for the duration of the function in which they are declared.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example of the scope and lifetime of variables in C:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
#include < stdio.h>
    int main() {
        int local_variable = 1; // Local variable 
        static int global_variable = 2; // Global variable
        printf("The local variable is %d\n", local_variable); 
        printf("The global variable is %d\n", global_variable);
        return 0;
    }
                        </pre>
                        <p>In this example, the local_variable is declared inside of the main() function, so it has a
                            local scope. The global_variable is declared outside of any function, so it has a global
                            scope.</p>
                        <p>The local_variable will exist in memory only for the duration of the main() function. The
                            global_variable will exist in memory for the entire lifetime of the program.</p>

                        <p>A function prototype in C is a function declaration specifying the function’s return type,
                            name, and the number and types of its parameters. It acts as a contract between the function
                            definition and its callers, providing information about the expected inputs and outputs of
                            the function. </p>
                        <p>The C function prototype is a statement that tells the compiler about the function's name,
                            its return type, numbers and data types of its parameters. </p>
                        <p>By using this information, the compiler cross-checks function parameters and their data type
                            with function definition and function call.</p>

                        <p>Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
                            The process of recursion consists of multiple recursive calls. The function that calls
                            itself is called a recursive function.</p>

                        <p>An array in C is a collection of data items of the same data type that are stored in
                            contiguous memory locations. The data items in an array are accessed using an index, which
                            is an integer value that specifies the position of the item in the array.</p>
                        <p>To declare an array in C, you use the following syntax:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
                            data_type array_name [size];
                        </pre>
                        <p>where data_type is the type of the data items in the array, array_name is the name of the
                            array, and size is the number of elements in the array.</p>
                        <p>For example, the following code declares an array of 10 integers:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
                            int numbers [10];
                        </pre>
                        <p>To access an element in an array, you use the following syntax:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
                            array_name [index]
                        </pre>
                        <p>where array_name is the name of the array, and index is the index of the element you want to
                            access.</p>
                        <p>For example, the following code prints the value of the first element in the numbers array:
                        </p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
                            printf("%d\n", numbers [0]);
                        </pre>
                        <p>You can also use the for loop to iterate over the elements of an array. For example, the
                            following code prints the values of all elements in the numbers array:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
                            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
                            { 
                                printf("%d\n", numbers [i]);
                            }
                        </pre>
                        <p>Arrays are a powerful tool for storing and manipulating data in C. They can be used to solve
                            a variety of problems, such as sorting, searching, and filtering data.</p>

                        <p><b><u>What is Pointer?</u></b></p>
                        <p>A pointer in C is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are
                            used to access the memory of the said variable and then manipulate their addresses in a
                            program.</p>
                        <p><b><u>What is Memory Address?</u></b></p>
                        <p>The memory address is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer. A pointer
                            basically stores the memory address of a variable as its value. To print pointer values, we
                            use the %p format specifier.</p>
                        <p><b>In C, there are three types of pointers:</b></p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>Integer pointers: - These pointers store the memory address of an integer variable.</ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>Character pointers: - These pointers store the memory address of a character variable.</ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>Void pointers: - These pointers can store the memory address of any type of variable.</ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Pointers are important in C, because they allow us to manipulate the data in the computer's
                            memory. This can reduce the code and improve the performance.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example of how to use a pointer in C:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
                            int main() { 
                                int x = 10;
                                int* p = &x;
                                
                                printf("%p\n", p); // Prints the address of x
                                
                                *p = 20; // Changes the value of x to 20
                            
                                printf("%d\n", x); // Prints the value of x, which is now 20
                            
                                return 0;
                            }
                        </pre>
                        <p>In this example, the p pointer is used to store the memory address of the x variable. The *p
                            operator is used to dereference the pointer, which means that it is used to access the data
                            that is stored at the memory address that the pointer points to. In this case, the *p
                            operator is used to change the value of the x variable to 20.</p>

                        <p>Pointer arithmetic is a C programming concept that allows you to perform arithmetic
                            operations on pointers, such as addition, subtraction, increment, and decrement. The size of
                            the data type the pointer points to determines the size of the step taken during the
                            arithmetic operation.</p>
                        <p> For example, if you have a pointer to an int, then adding 1 to the pointer will move it to
                            the next int in memory. Similarly, if you have a pointer to a char, then adding 1 to the
                            pointer will move it to the next char in memory.</p>
                        <p>Pointer arithmetic can be used to iterate over arrays and structures. For example, the
                            following code would iterate over the array arr of 5 integers:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
                            int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
                            int *ptr = arr;

                            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                            printf("%d\n", *ptr);
                            ptr++;
                            }
                        </pre>
                        <p>The output of the code would be:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
                            1
                            2
                            3

                            5
                        </pre>
                        <p>Pointer arithmetic can also be used to compare pointers. For example, the following code
                            would compare the pointers ptr1 and ptr2 to see if they point to the same memory location:
                        </p>

                        <p>Well, in C, the name of an array, is actually a pointer to the first element of the array.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let's try to understand this better, and use our "memory address example" above again.</p>
                        <p>The memory address of the first element is the same as the name of the array:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">
                            Example
                            int myNumbers [4] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                            // Get the memory address of the myNumbers array 
                            printf("%p\n", myNumbers);

                            // Get the memory address of the first array element 
                            printf("%p\n", &myNumbers[0]);

                            Result:
                            0x7ffe70f9d8f0
                            0x7ffe70f9d8f0
                        </pre>
                        <p>This way of working with arrays might seem a bit excessive. Especially with simple arrays
                            like in the examples above. However, for large arrays, it can be much more efficient to
                            access and manipulate arrays with pointers. </p>
                        <p>It is also considered faster and easier to access two-dimensional arrays with pointers.</p>
                        <p>And since strings are actually arrays, you can also use pointers to access strings.</p>
                        <p>For now, it's great that you know how this works. But like we specified in the previous
                            chapter; pointers must be handled with care, since it is possible to overwrite other data
                            stored in memory.</p>

                        <p>A struct in the C programming language (and many derivatives) is a composite data type (or
                            record) declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name in a
                            block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by
                            the struct declared name which returns the same address. The struct data type can contain
                            other data types so is used for mixed-data-type records such as a hard-drive directory entry
                            (file length, name, extension, physical address, etc.), or other mixed-type records (name,
                            address, telephone, balance, etc.).</p>
                        <p>Here is an example of how to define and use structures in C:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">                           
                            // Define a structure 
                            struct employee { 
                                int id;
                                char name[20];
                                float salary;
                            };
                            // Create a structure variable
                            struct employee employee1;

                            // Initialize the structure variable
                            employee1.id = 1234;
                            strcpy(employee1.name, "John Doe"); 
                            employee1.salary = 100000.00;

                            // Print the structure variable
                            printf("Employee ID: %d\n", employee1.id);
                            printf("Employee Name: %s\n", employee1.name);
                            printf("Employee Salary: %.2f\n", employee1.salary);
                        </pre>
                        <p>In this example, we define a structure named employee with three members: id, name, and
                            salary. We then create a structure variable named employee1 and initialize its members.
                            Finally, we print the values of the structure variable.</p>

                        <p>You can use the struct keyword to define a structure.</p>
                        <p>You can use the sizeof() operator to determine the size of a structure.</p>
                        <p>You can use the strcpy() function to copy a string to a structure member.</p>

                        <p><b><u>What is Unions in C?</u></b></p>
                        <p>A union in C is a user-defined data type that allows different types of data to be stored in
                            the same memory location. It provides a way to define a variable that may have different
                            data types, but at any given time, only one member of the union can hold a value.</p>
                        <p>The syntax for defining a union in C is:</p>
                        <code>"union unionName { //member definitions };"</code>
                        <p>For example, the following code defines a union with two members: an integer and a float:</p>
                        <code>"union intFloatUnion <br> { <br>
                            int intMember; <br>
                            float floatMember; <br>
                          };"<br> </code>
                        <p>To use a union, you can declare a variable of the union type and then assign a value to one
                            of the members. For example, the following code declares a variable of type
                            unionIntFloatUnion and then assigns the value 10 to the intMember member:</p>
                        <code>"unionIntFloatUnion myUnion; <br>
                            myUnion.intMember = 10;"</code>
                        <p>You can then access the value of the intMember member by using the . operator:</p>
                        <code>"printf("%d\n", myUnion.intMember);"</code>
                        <p>This will print the value 10 to the console.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that only one member of a union can contain a value at a time. For
                            example, the following code will not compile:</p>
                        <code>unionIntFloatUnion myUnion; <br>
                            myUnion.intMember = 10; <br> 
                            myUnion.floatMember = 3.14;</code>
                        <p>This is because the floatMember member is already occupied by the value 10. To assign a value
                            to the floatMember member, you must first clear the value of the intMember member: </p>
                        <code>myUnion.intMember = 0; <br> 
                                myUnion.floatMember = 3.14;</code>
                        <p>This will print the value 3.14 to the console.</p>
                        <p>Unions can be used to optimize memory usage. For example, if you need to store an integer and
                            a float, you can use a union to store both values in the same memory location. This can be
                            useful if you are short on memory or if you want to avoid having to allocate multiple memory
                            locations for different data types.</p>

                        <p><b><u>What is Bit Feidls in C?</u></b></p>
                        <p>A bit field in C is a data structure that allows you to allocate memory to structures and
                            unions in bits in order to use computer memory in an efficient manner.</p>
                        <p>Since structures and unions are user-defined data types in C, the user has an idea of how
                            much memory they will occupy. Accordingly, by the implementation of bit fields, memory
                            management becomes easy and efficient.</p>
                        <p>The following example taken from GeeksforGeeks shows how bit fields can be used to conserve
                            memory -</p>

                            of m, and 16 bits to store the value of y.</p>
                        <p>Bit fields can be used to represent any data structure that has a limited number of possible
                            values. For example, you could use bit fields to represent a 'color' structure, where the
                            possible values are red, green, blue, and black.</p>

                        <p><b><u>What is Structures & Pointers?</u></b></p>
                        <p>In C, a structure is a user-defined data type that allows you to group together variables of
                            different data types under a single name. A structure pointer is a pointer that points to
                            the address of a structure variable.</p>
                        <p>To declare a structure, you use the struct keyword, followed by the name of the structure,
                            and then a list of members. For example:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">                           
                            struct student { char name[20];
                                int age;
                                float grade;
                            };
                        </pre>
                        <p>To create a structure variable, you use the struct keyword, followed by the name of the
                            structure, and then a list of values for the members. For example:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">                            
                            struct student student1 = {
                                "John Doe",
                                20,
                                3.5
                            };
                        </pre>
                        <p>To access a member of a structure, you use the -> operator. For example:</p>
                        <code>"printf("The student's name is %s.\n", student1.name);"</code>
                        <p>To declare a structure pointer, you use the struct keyword, followed by the name of the
                            structure, and then a pointer to the structure. For example:</p>
                        <code>"struct student *studentptr;"</code>
                        <p>To assign a structure pointer to a structure variable, you use the =` operator. For example:
                        </p>
                        <code>"studentptr = &student1;"</code>
                        <p>To access a member of a structure through a pointer, you use the -> operator. For example:
                        </p>
                        <code>"printf("The student's name is %s.\n", studentptr->name);"</code>
                        <p>Structure pointers can be used to create complex data structures, such as linked lists,
                            trees, and graphs.</p>

                        <p><b><u>What is Nested Structures?</u></b></p>
                        <p>A nested structure in C is a structure that contains one or more members that are themselves
                            structures. This can be used to create complex data structures that can be used to represent
                            real-world objects and relationships.</p>
                        <p>To define a nested structure, you can simply define one structure inside another structure.
                            For example:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">                         
                            struct employee { 
                                int employee_id; 
                                char *name;
                                float salary;
                            };
                            struct organization { 
                                char *organization_name; 
                                int organization_number; 
                                struct employee employee; 
                            };
                        </pre>
                        <p>In this example, the organization structure contains a member of type employee. This means
                            that an organization structure can contain an employee structure.</p>
                        <p>To access members of a nested structure, you use the dot operator (.). For example:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">                      
                            struct organization organization; 
                            struct employee employee;

                            organization.employee.employee_id = 1234;
                            organization.employee.name = "John Smith";
                            organization.employee.salary = 100000.00;
                        </pre>
                        <p>In this example, we are setting the employee_id, name, and salary members of the employee
                            structure that is a member of the organization structure.</p>
                        <p> Nested structures can be used to create complex data structures that can be used to
                            represent real-world objects and relationships. For example, you could use a nested
                            structure to represent a company, with the organization structure representing the company
                            and the employee structure representing an employee.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example of how you could use a nested structure to represent a company:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">                         
                            struct company {
                                char *company_name;
                                int company_number; 
                                struct employee *employees;
                            };
                            struct employee {
                                int employee_id;
                                char *name;
                                float salary;
                            };
                        </pre>
                        <p>In this example, the company structure contains a member of type employee *, which is a
                            pointer to an array of employee structures. This means that a company structure can contain
                            an array of employee structures.</p>
                        <p>To access the members of an array of nested structures, you can use the [] operator. For
                            example:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block">                           
                            struct company company; 
                            struct employee employee;

                            company.employees[0].employee_id = 1234; 
                            company.employees[0].name = "John Smith"; 
                            company.employees[0].salary = 100000.00;

                            company.employees[1]. employee_id = 5678; 
                            company.employees[1].name = "Jane Doe"; 
                            company.employees[1]. salary = 150000.00;
                        </pre>
                        <p>In this example, we are setting the employee_id, name, and salary members of the first and
                            second employee structures that are members of the company structure.</p>
                        <p>Nested structures can be used to create complex data structures that can be used to represent
                            real-world objects and relationships. This is a powerful tool that can be used to create
                            more realistic and sophisticated programs.</p>
