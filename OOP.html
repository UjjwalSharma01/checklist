            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular and reusable code.

            Encapsulation

          </label>
          <div class="hidden-text">
            Encapsulation in C++ is the process of bundling data and code together into a single unit called a class. This allows us to hide the implementation details of the class from the outside world, and only expose public methods that allow users to interact with the data in a controlled way.

            Operator Overloading
            <span class="dropdown-arrow"></span>
          </label>
          <div class="hidden-text">
            Operator overloading is a feature of C++ that allows programmers to define their own behavior for built-in operators. This can be useful for working with user-defined data types, such as complex numbers or fractions.
            To overload an operator, you must define a member function whose name is operator followed by the symbol for the operator you are overloading. The function must have the same return type and parameter list as the built-in operator.   
          <pre class="code-snippet">
            <p>Example Code:</p>
            <code>
            class ComplexNumber {
              public:
                ComplexNumber(double real, double imaginary) : real_(real), imaginary_(imaginary) {}
              
                ComplexNumber operator+(const ComplexNumber& other) const {
                  return ComplexNumber(real_ + other.real_, imaginary_ + other.imaginary_);
                }

            Templates in C++

          <div class="hidden-text">
            A template in C++ is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or function. Generic programming is a technique where generic types are used as parameters in algorithms so that they can work for a variety of data types.
            Templates can be used to create generic classes that can work with different data types, or to create generic functions that can be used to perform operations on different data types.

            Exception Handling
            <span class="dropdown-arrow"></span>
          </label>
          <div class="hidden-text">
            Exception handling in C++ is a way to handle errors that occur during program execution. It is based on three keywords: try, catch, and throw.
            try: The try block contains the code that may throw an exception.
            catch: The catch blocks follow the try block and contain code to handle different types of exceptions.
            throw: The throw keyword is used to throw an exception.
            When an exception is thrown, the program execution jumps to the first catch block that matches the type of the exception. If there is no matching catch block, the program terminates.     
            <pre class="code-snippet">
              <p>Example Code:</p>
              <code>
                #include <iostream>

                  using namespace std;
                  
                  int main() {
                    try {
                      // This code may throw an exception.
                      int x = 10 / 0;
                    } catch (const exception& e) {
                      // Handle the exception here.
                      cout << "An exception occurred: " << e.what() << endl;

            Standard Template Library (STL)

          <div class="hidden-text">
            The Standard Template Library (STL) is a software library that provides a set of generic data structures and algorithms. It is part of the C++ Standard Library and is widely used in C++ programming.
            The STL is divided into three main components:
            Containers: Containers are objects that store collections of data. Some common STL containers include vectors, lists, maps, and sets.
            Algorithms: Algorithms are functions that operate on containers. Some common STL algorithms include sort(), search(), and count().
            Iterators: Iterators are objects that allow you to step through the elements of a container in a sequential order.

            RAII, or Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, is a programming idiom used in C++ to ensure that resources are automatically released when they are no longer needed. This is done by binding the lifetime of a resource to the lifetime of an object.

            Friend Functions and Classes

          <div class="hidden-text">
            A friend function is a function that is not a member of a class but can access the private and protected members of the class. A friend class is a class that can access the private and protected members of another class. Friend functions and classes are useful for situations where you need to allow a function or class to access the private and protected members of another class. For example, you might want to use a friend function to implement a global function that operates on objects of a particular class, or you might want to use a friend class to implement a helper class that works closely with another class.

            Multiple Inheritance

          </label>
          <div class="hidden-text">
            Multiple inheritance in C++ is a feature that allows a class to inherit from more than one base class. This can be useful for modeling real-world situations where a class may have multiple different types of behavior. For example, a class representing a car could inherit from a Vehicle class and an Automobile class. The Vehicle class could provide the car with the basic functionality of being able to move and steer, while the Automobile class could provide it with more specific functionality such as having an engine and transmission.
            <pre class="code-snippet">

          <div class="hidden-text">
            Smart pointers are a type of pointer in C++ that automatically manage the lifetime of the object they point to. This means that the programmer does not need to worry about manually deleting the object when it is no longer needed, which can help to prevent memory leaks.
            <p>The three types of small pointers are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>unique_ptr:</strong> A unique_ptr can only have one owner at a time.
                When the unique_ptr goes out of scope, it will automatically delete the object it points to.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>shared_ptr:</strong> A shared_ptr can have multiple owners at the same time.
                The object it points to will be deleted when the last shared_ptr goes out of scope.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>weak_ptr:</strong> A weak_ptr does not own the object it points to.

            Composition and aggregation are ways to create relationships between objects. Understand the differences between these two approaches and when to use them in your C++ programs.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Composition:</strong> Composition is a strong relationship where the parent class owns the child class. This means that the child class cannot exist independently of the parent class. When the parent class is destroyed, the child class is also destroyed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Aggregation:</strong> Aggregation is a weaker relationship where the parent class has a reference to the child class. This means that the child class can exist independently of the parent class. When the parent class is destroyed, the child class is not automatically destroyed.

            Virtual base classes in C++ are used to avoid multiple instances of a given class from appearing in an inheritance hierarchy when using multiple inheritances.

            Object Serialization

          <div class="hidden-text">
            Object serialization is the process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes that can be stored or transmitted. This can be useful for storing data to a file, sending data over a network, or persisting data between program executions. There are many different ways to serialize objects in C++. One common approach is to use the Boost serialization library. Boost serialization provides a generic framework for serializing and deserializing objects of any type.
